# Covi_Armour
CoviArmour is our way of combining visualization made possible through an Immersive Augmented Reality(AR) experience and the field of healthcare.  CoviArmour is decided to have 4 components as of now as contemplated by our team.As our problem statement signifies, according to the problems we have appropriate solutions to  different aspects. And have merged finally all into one app. Given below is a vivid list CoviArmour's components-  respectively.  1 Correct Statistics - CoviArmour has an AR on-spot map informing you the statistics all round the country. 2 Physical Wellbeing- which informs you about the nearest hospitals and pharmacies in your location radius. 3 Mental Wellbeing- which progresses to create an meditation environment for the people, and we have thought of adding videos too to help users in basic covid-aided yoga, so as to help in dealing with anxiety, hypertension etc. 4 Lesser Known guide about the disease- this section would act to be a guide, providing information about lesser known but important facts and techniques about how to combat this deadly virus and videos related to them. All the aspects are covered in a single place so it would prove to be user friendly. People can stop hunting search engines for the required accurate guidance and hence save time.  -And all this can be achieved by simply installing an software applications on our mobile phones. No additional hardware is required.
